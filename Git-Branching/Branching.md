## Git Branching 

![Git Branching](https://www.nobledesktop.com/image/gitresources/git-branches-merge.png "Branching")

#### commands

1. git branch (it shows the branch you have)
2. git checkout + BranchName (This command will allow you to surf on all the braches)
3. git checkout -b + NewBrach (create a new brach)

#### Flowing through branches

if you created a new branch(feature branch) and you save new contend on that branch the changes only will be inside the branch; if you call the main branch you won't see the new content there.
